# lightroom-delete-preset-settings
It’s a little AppleScript which allows you to remove Sharpening and Noise Reduction Develop-Settings of Adobe Lightroom Preset files (.lrtemplate or .xmp).

You can easily change the script to remove other Develop-Settings of Presets by adjusting the “removeKeywords” variable.
